        Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. In your world you have
        total and absolute power. The least little bit can do so much.
        Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen.

        Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. We'll paint one
        happy little tree right here. You have to allow the paint to break to
        make it beautiful. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. Just use the
        old one inch brush. See there, told you that would be easy. Let your
        imagination be your guide. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it.
        Don't fight it, use what happens. This is the way you take out your
        flustrations. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much
        better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your
        spouse.

        Here's another little happy bush By now you should be quite happy about
        what's happening here. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they
        are very important. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little
        happy things in here. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have
        big clouds. All kinds of happy little splashes. If we're gonna walk
        though the woods, we need a little path. Painting should do one thing.
        It should put happiness in your heart. You can get away with a lot.
